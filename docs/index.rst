Planetary I/O (Plio) is an open source collection of my commonly used I/O functionality. Plio is licensed in `the public domain`_.

About the image: The `Walters Art Museum`_ has scanned and released into the public domain a twelfth century illuminated manuscript
created by Christian monks that served as a scientific text.  The two reproduced pages illustrate 'the heavens'.
